PLEASE NOTE, NOTE IT DOWN TO MAKE YOUR AND MINE LIVES SMOOTH!

I use and, or reccomend only offcial/standard tools for building,
installing and, or ArchLinux packages and AUR's.

The 'yaourt' seems as complicated as its name, hence better you
avoid it; if you still don't like the idea -- you may update the
AUR's with 'yaourt', but do build and, or install using the nice 
*makepkg* only.

Hope that helps,
As ever,
